Movie Release Timeline Analysis
===============================

> "We're talking about Thunderdome. It's from before you were born."

> "Most movies are from before I was born."

That statement spurred a pretty interesting question: *what's the date where that 
statement is no longer true?* Put another way, *what date in history has an equal 
number of films made before and after it?*

Python, [pandas](pandas.pydata.org), and [D3.js](d3js.org) were used for the analysis and visualization. 
The data was pulled from [IMDB's data dumps](www.imdb.com/interfaces) on 2014-01-21.
